# Taksy
A php/mysql based project/task mangager that is still in alpha stage of development

Right now this project is not fully functioning, it fetches data from the database, based on a username en renders a page.

For the future, the ability to mark tasks done has to be added, then tasks and project must be able to be added by the user (mysql safe)
Also the login now just ignores the password, I need a safe/secure way to handle that.

When all that is functional I need options for users to be created and edited. At that point this would be considered beta.

After the beta maybe some other features may be added (shared projects, custom themes)
